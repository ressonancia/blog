Welcome to the Ressonance blog — a place built for developers who care about clarity, reliability, and simplicity when working with real-time applications

# Welcome to the Ressonance Blog

Ressonance is a WebSocket as a Service platform designed to solve the most common and painful problems developers face when using WebSockets in production. Our mission is simple: make real-time communication easy, and reliable so you can focus on building features instead of infrastructure.

## Why Ressonance Exists

If you’ve ever implemented WebSockets yourself, you probably ran into at least one of these problems:

* Complex infrastructure setup (servers, load balancers, scaling strategies)
* Managing Redis, cache layers, and pub/sub
* Handling unexpected user disconnections
* Users being dropped during deploys or restarts
* Massive reconnection storms causing accidental self-DDoS
* Debugging race conditions and edge cases in production

Ressonance was created to remove all of that friction.

With Ressonance, you don’t need to think about infrastructure, scaling, cache, Redis, reconnection strategies, or deployment issues. You simply subscribe, publish events, and move on. We take care of everything else (yes we do, trust us).

That’s the promise of WebSocket as a Service — and we take it seriously.

## Built by Developers, for Developers

Ressonance was built with a strong focus on developer experience from day one. In fact, the platform was initially created to solve real problems faced by Laravel developers, and it was built on top of Laravel Echo, embracing familiar patterns like channels, events, and presence out of the box.

While the platform has grown beyond its original scope, that foundation still shapes our decisions today: clear abstractions, predictable behavior, and APIs that feel natural instead of magical.

## Transparent, Open, and Built in Public

One of our core values is transparency.

* We build Ressonance in public
* We openly share progress, decisions, and challenges on Twitter: [@RessonanceCom](https://x.com/Ressonancecom)
* Our entire codebase is open source

This means you can see exactly how things work, how decisions are made, and where the platform is going. No black boxes. No hidden behavior. No vendor lock-in surprises.

## What You’ll Find on This Blog

On this blog, we’ll share:

* Practical guides on WebSockets and real-time architecture
* Deep dives into channels, events, and scaling patterns
* Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
* Product updates and roadmap discussions
* Lessons learned from building a real-time SaaS in public

Whether you’re new to WebSockets or already running real-time systems in production, our goal is to provide clear, actionable, developer-first content.

## Get Started with Ressonance

If you want to build real-time features without fighting infrastructure, reconnect storms, or fragile setups, **Ressonance is ready for you.**

You can sign up, connect your application, and start sending events in minutes — while we handle the hard parts behind the scenes.
